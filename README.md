# Notes Explorer

This is a plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) that displays all your notes as cards for better visual navigation and revision of your notes. Explore your vault using the explorer view by using various filters.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Notice :** Initially started as simple fork from the [Cards View plugin](https://github.com/jillro/obsidian-cards-view-plugin), now has become a highly functional plugin in itself with a lot of new functionalities. I started integrating all these new features for my personal use-case. But, now after hearing the suggestions from few of the users, I have decided to publish this fork plugin with all these new changes to Obsidian marketplace, as I presume, the future development plan of Cards view plugin might not align with my changes. This Beta version will be now published with a new name : **Notes Explorer**.

## Features

- Display notes as cards arranged in a masonry view or Gallery view.
- Sorts by last modified time, created time and note filename either as ascending or descending order.
- Filters to show/hide empty notes.
- See notes from specificc folders using **Folder tag**. Also use sub-folder filter to view all notes from even the sub-folders.
- Click on folder name from file explorer to open the explorer board for notes within that folder.
- Two different types of tag based color indicators (background color and sidebars).
